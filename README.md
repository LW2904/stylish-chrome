Stylish - a user style manager for Google Chrome.

This is an ugly and quick fix born out of annoyance. During my testing the extension never sent any requests, and I replaced all tracking related functions that I found with stubs or removed them.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `free-stylish.ctx` from the [Releases](https://github.com/LW2904/stylish-chrome/releases) section.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` and drag n' drop the downloaded file onto the page.
3. Review the permissions and proceed to add the extension.
